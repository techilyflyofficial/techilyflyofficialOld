    <h2>Types of Digital Marketing</h2>
    <p>There are many types of digital marketing. Let’s look at the most popular ones:</p>

    <h3>1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>
    <p>
      SEO means making your website better so it shows up on Google when people search for something. For example, if you run a bakery, SEO helps your site appear when someone searches "best chocolate cake near me".
    </p>

    <h3>2. Content Marketing</h3>
    <p>
      This is about creating helpful content like blogs, videos, or infographics to attract and engage people. The goal is to provide value first and sell later.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Social Media Marketing</h3>
    <p>
      Using platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter to connect with your audience. It's a great way to build brand awareness and trust.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Pay-Per-Click Advertising (PPC)</h3>
    <p>
      This includes ads you see on Google or social media. You pay only when someone clicks on your ad.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Email Marketing</h3>
    <p>
      Sending emails to people who have signed up for your updates. This is still one of the most effective marketing tools today.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Affiliate Marketing</h3>
    <p>
      This is where others promote your product on their site or platform. When someone buys through their link, they earn a commission.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Influencer Marketing</h3>
    <p>
      Here, you pay influencers (people with a big following) to talk about your brand. It helps build trust quickly with their audience.
